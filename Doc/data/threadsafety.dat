# Each line has the form:
#   function_name : level
#
# Where level is one of:
#   incompatible -- not safe even with external locking
#   compatible   -- safe if the caller serializes all access with external locks
#   safe         -- safe for concurrent use
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
# The function name must match the C domain identifier used in the documentation.
